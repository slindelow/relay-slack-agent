# RELAY — Build Status vs Final Output

**Final output target:** Fully working Slack Marketplace plugin for Slack Connect channels, primarily serving CRM-connected CS teams.

## 🟢 Live Beta Validation (2026-06-24)

Core product loop **validated end-to-end** in the live "RELAY Beta" Slack Connect workspace on Railway. 8/14 checklist steps PASS (1,2,3,5,7,9,10,11). Full chain works: customer question → classify → SLA DM alert → claim → **MCP-powered cited draft (Sonnet 4.6)** → review modal → bot posts approved response → resolved; `/relay ask` returns cited results from an indexed GitHub source.

Six live bugs fixed this session (all on `main`): channel-mention parser (`1c27eeb`), worker async event-loop/NullPool (`cc3f63d`), embedding dims 1024 (`0772760`), retired model IDs (`d5bf4a6`), App Home draft-review surfacing (`f1152d9`), draft-modal button style (`36bb082`). Plus Slack app config (escape/interactivity/events/scope/messages-tab) and Voyage payment method. See `docs/HANDOFF.md` 2026-06-24 entry and `docs/deployment/beta-validation-checklist.md` for details.

Follow-up audit on 2026-06-25 fixed the highest-value beta polish items in code/docs: customer-facing approved-response copy no longer exposes raw Slack IDs or approval workflow language, `slack-app-manifest.yaml` now matches the live Slack config, and Railway exports `PYTHONPATH=/app` from `scripts/entrypoint.sh`. Remaining checklist: 4 HubSpot (deferred), 6 setup-complete (3/4 until HubSpot), 8 SLA timer, 12 pulse ARR (needs HubSpot), 13 delete, 14 uninstall.

## Immediate Next Steps

1. Keep Plan 9 as the active shared plan in `docs/PLAN_9_PRIVATE_BETA_LAUNCH.md`.
2. Split Plan 9 into scoped PRs: deployment/distribution, onboarding UX, connector/CRM readiness, production KMS, live beta validation, and external packaging.
3. Merge any remaining Plan 6/7/8 branches before product behavior branches that depend on them.

## Critical Path to Private Beta, Then Marketplace

```
Plan 9A: deployable beta stack + Slack manifest/install path
       ↓
Plan 9B: admin onboarding + /relay settings + first-admin bootstrap
       ↓
Plan 9C: HubSpot upsert + admin-driven source connector setup
       ↓
Plan 9D: Railway beta preflight + encryption smoke
       ↓
Plan 9E: live Slack Connect beta validation
       ↓
Marketplace submission package
```

## Known TODOs (non-blocking)

- (Optional) Auto-generate draft on **Claim** to match the spec's "claim → draft modal" flow (currently a separate "Generate draft" action).
- Redis dedup on ingestion (idempotency key check before classify) — in `relay/worker/tasks.py` — next Codex task on `codex/mcp-rts-beta-foundation`
- `Question.snoozed_until` field is dead schema — remove in a future migration (Snooze table is authoritative)
- Railway beta uses `KMS_PROVIDER=none` plus `TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY`; AWS KMS remains the later hardened production path.
- Admin-driven connector setup exists for beta; full OAuth-based connector onboarding remains post-beta polish.

## Audit Updates — 2026-06-25

- ✅ Fixed customer-facing approved-response copy in `relay/slack/draft_actions.py`; messages now read `From <display name> via RELAY` or fall back to `From your customer success team via RELAY` without raw Slack IDs.
- ✅ Synced `slack-app-manifest.yaml` to the live beta requirements: Messages Tab enabled, `/relay` escaping enabled, `message.channels` event added, and `channels:history` scope included.
- ✅ Made the Railway `classifier` import workaround durable by exporting `PYTHONPATH=/app` in `scripts/entrypoint.sh`.
- ✅ Updated scope/docs/tests to reflect the public Slack Connect beta path and the new manifest contract.

## Plan 9 Progress

- ✅ Created active Plan 9 source of truth in `docs/PLAN_9_PRIVATE_BETA_LAUNCH.md`.
- ✅ Added private-beta Railway deployment runbook in `docs/deployment/private-beta-railway.md`.
- ✅ Kept AWS deployment runbook in `docs/deployment/private-beta-aws.md` as the later hardening path.
- ✅ Added checked-in Slack app manifest in `slack-app-manifest.yaml`.
- ✅ Added minimal container artifacts (`Dockerfile`, `.dockerignore`) for web/worker/beat services.
- ✅ Added public private-beta install page at `/`.
- ✅ Added `/relay settings` setup summary and first-admin bootstrap for workspaces with zero admins.
- ✅ Replaced HubSpot sync stub with workspace-scoped company-to-`CustomerAccount` upsert.
- ✅ Enabled `KMS_PROVIDER=aws` provider selection with `KMS_KEY_ID` validation for later AWS hardening.
- ✅ Added KMS smoke script (`scripts/smoke_kms.py`) with Railway local-mode support and AWS IAM/runbook instructions.
- ✅ Added manual private beta acceptance checklist in `docs/deployment/private-beta-acceptance.md`.
- ✅ Added beta GitHub/Google Drive connector setup modals, encrypted credential storage, and sync enqueue from `/relay settings`.
- ✅ Added DB-backed Slack installation store tests.
- 🚧 Next: deploy Railway beta, run beta preflight/live smoke, then run live Slack Connect beta validation.
- ✅ Added MCP + Slack RTS context foundation locally: governed context contracts, MCP facade, Slack Search consent, encrypted per-user search tokens, context tool logs, `/relay ask` + draft context routing.
- 🚧 Next: implement Redis idempotency, then resume Railway live Slack validation with `/slack/search/oauth_redirect` configured.

## Plan 6 Progress

- ✅ US-001: Added `0006_plan6_memory.py` and `KnowledgeEntry`; Codex fixed ORM/migration FK drift so tenant-scoped metadata matches Alembic.
- ✅ US-002: Added `index_approved_response()` and wired sent drafts into resolution memory indexing.
- ✅ US-003: Retrieval cites memory chunks as `relay_memory` and increments `reuse_count`.
- ✅ US-004: Added `/relay ask <question>` routing and ephemeral source results.
- ✅ US-005: Added App Home impact metrics section with 30-day SLA met rate, draft accepted rate, median time to send, and total handled count.
- ✅ US-006: Added App Home accuracy section with 7-day correction count, classification accuracy, and feedback export link.
- ✅ US-007: Added admin feedback export endpoint with Slack auth.test, admin role check, JSONL streaming, and day-window clamp.
- ✅ US-008: Added `/relay pulse [account]` account digest with summary and detailed Block Kit responses.
- ✅ Plan 6 draft PR opened: #14.

## Plan 7 Progress

- ✅ US-005: Added public `/privacy`, `/terms`, and `/sub-processors` pages.
- ✅ US-006: Added `docs/marketplace/scope-justification.md`.
- ✅ US-008: Added optional Sentry initialization, dependency-aware `/health` (`db`, `redis`, 503 on dependency failure), Redis CI service, and `celery inspect ping` worker health step.
- ✅ US-002: Added workspace deletion job table/model, `/relay delete-workspace-data` confirmation modal, workspace-scoped Celery deletion task, Slack uninstall token revocation + deletion enqueue, and CI-backed full-data-tree DB test.
- ✅ US-003: Added App Home "Disconnect + Purge" flow and connector-id-scoped purge task for chunks/documents + disconnected marker.
- ✅ US-001: Added KMS columns, AWS KMS provider abstraction, DEK helpers, mocked KMS tests, workspace-DEK write/read paths with global-key fallback, legacy fallback marker, and offline re-encryption script.
- ✅ US-004: Added signed-confirmation admin user erasure endpoint, `users.deleted_at`, and anonymization of user PII plus nullable actor references.
- ✅ US-007: Added idempotent `scripts/seed_reviewer_sandbox.py` and `docs/marketplace/reviewer-walkthrough.md`.
- ✅ Plan 7 complete locally. The full-data-tree deletion test skips on this machine because Postgres/Docker are unavailable, and is set up to run under CI's Postgres service.

## Plan 8 Progress

- ✅ Added centralized `require_relay_admin()` and `require_relay_csm()` authorization helpers.
- ✅ Added admin checks for workspace deletion, channel registration, connector purge, HubSpot install, and admin export/erasure flows.
- ✅ Added CSM/admin checks for draft open, generate, send, discard, and regenerate actions.
- ✅ Resolved Slack workspaces from `team_id` before tenant-scoped action lookups and tightened explicit `workspace_id` predicates.
- ✅ Hardened HubSpot OAuth state and individual-erasure confirmation tokens with signed timestamps and expiry.
- ✅ Guarded empty erasure secrets, validated HubSpot workspace binding, redacted HubSpot response bodies, and made AWS KMS configuration fail explicitly until implemented.
- ✅ Cleaned up deletion cascade coverage, SLA token revocation field usage, drafting retry behavior, dead code, and configurable summary model.
- ✅ Verification on 2026-06-08: `.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q` — 248 passed, 20 skipped, 1 existing Starlette/httpx warning; compileall and `git diff --check` passed.
